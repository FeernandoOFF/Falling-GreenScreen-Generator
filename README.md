## Falling Object Green screen generator

My girlfriend needed some falling pizzas for one of her videos and I couldn't find any free options.
Many online options for falling objects with green screen have some kind of paywall or watermark, so I figured that it can be automated.

Output example:

### Usage

1. Run the project
This will open a webpage where you can edit
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Edit the assets and variables
You can just point to a PNG/JPG URL and it will be loaded

3. Export

Just press "Render", select your options and you should be good-to-go.



I started an option to add 3D models, but I didn't finish it, if you need it, feel free to ping me or fork the project :D
