## Falling Object Green screen generator

Many online options for falling objects with green screen have some kind of paywall or watermark, so I figured that it can be automated.

Output example:
![](./public/Scene-copy.mp4)


### Usage

1. Run the project
This will open a webpage where you can edit
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Edit the assets and variables

![](./public/Usage-demo.mp4)

3. Export

Just press "Render", select your options and you should be good-to-go.



There's an option to add 3D models, but so far I haven't worked on it
